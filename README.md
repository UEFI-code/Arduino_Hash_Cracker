# Arduino Hash Cracker

Using C/C++ For High Efficacy!

Current Supported Hash: SHA256, (Will add more)

## Working on almost all Arduino MCU, including ESP8266!

(Maybe need little edit the Analog pin for randomSeed).

## Working on Non-Arduino MCU for just little edit.

(like Serial Communication code in STM32).

### Next Step:

Add more hash type.

Add Commandline / Web UI for Raspberry Pi, to support large-scale hash cracking.
